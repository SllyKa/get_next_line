# get_next_line
school21 simple project (C language)
 
A programm just reading text from input stream(file, stdin, etc.) and returning char sequence ending with "\n".  
It can process all the text if run in a loop and can work with several sources(read from file1, then file2, file3 then again file1 etc.)  

# Library
There is here a library - previous school21 project. It contains a lot of usefull functions to use in furter projects(it is all poorly structured, I don't correct it because I like to watch where i started)
